> solving Advent Of Code 2021 problems in Go


Each folder named `dayX` has the solution for each day. To see the part 1 of 
a specific day, you need to see the commit with the name `solve day X part 1`
or something like this. OBS: I decided to do it this way after the day1, so  
the solution of part 1 and 2 of day 1 is in the respective func `solve_1` and `solve_2`


## Usage
To run use `go run solve.go`
